# Group D

25. A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop” is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisinad roop” and observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. WCP with functions

  	a) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack \
  b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not

26. In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as (),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well parenthesized or not.

  b) Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format. \
  c) Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.

28. A classic problem that can be solved by backtracking is called the Eight Queens problem, which comes from the game of chess. The chess board consists of 64 square arranged in an 8 by 8 grid. The board normally alternates between black and white square, but this is not relevant for the present problem. The queen can move as far as she wants in any direction, as long as she follows a straight line, Vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. WCP with recursive function for generating all possible configurations for 4-queen's problem.

# Group E
29. Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. WCP for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.

30. Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an inorder list to store the items in the queue. Create a class that includes the data items (Which should be template) and the priority (Which should be `int`). The inorder list should contain these objects, with operator `<=` overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the start of the list (Which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)
