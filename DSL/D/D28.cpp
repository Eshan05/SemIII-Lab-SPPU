 * A classic problem that can be solved by backtracking is called the Eight
 Queens problem, which comes from the game of chess. The chess board consists of
 64 square arranged in an 8 by 8 grid. The board normally alternates between
 black and white square, but this is not relevant for the present problem. The
 queen can move as far as she wants in any direction, as long as she follows a
 straight line, Vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Write C++ program with
 recursive function for generating all possible configurations for 4-queen's
 problem.
